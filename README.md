# Tracks
Going forward in my juorney of building react applications, I did a lot of fun stuff with `listen-to-random-preview-songs` kinda app. I named it `tracks` since It just going to list 100 songs which you can play. As my first application, this is also my first try on music services so try to be noticed while I am building it :)

## What I am using to build this
Again [React](https://reactjs.org/) is the essential. But there are more which are listed below.

* For the interface, I am using [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). No need to talk about it since it is popular enough.
* For side effects, I am using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)...( again! ).
* I am using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication.
* The interesting part comes here where I am using [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for the first time. It is fun and productive where you just define your inputs, react-hook-form will handle other things out of the box.
* Last but not least, I am also using [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader). Great tool for managing web fonts provided by different services.
